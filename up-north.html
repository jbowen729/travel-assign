            <h2>Our trips "Up North"</h2>
            <p>My parents are a part of a club. The name of the club is G.A.P.O.T.E.N. It stands for grab a piece of the
                earth now. My grandfather was a founding member and passed it onto my dad. The members of this club
                pooled
                money together and purchased "the cabin." They remodeled and added indoor plumbing. The cabin started as
                a very
                small two bedroom fishing cottage complete with outhouse. The club added more square footage by building
                an addition.
                Now the cabin is four bigger bedrooms with a kitchen, dining,and living area. The club built a huge deck
                off the house. The stairs
                come off the deck to a 12 acre pond. The cabin is the only house on the water. We travel to the cabin
                every August. My
                boys love to fish. A few of the trips there weren't any fish in the pond. The first time it was because
                the pond had frozen
                over due to the extreme cold of the polar vortex. This year we aren't really sure what happened.</p>

            <p>The cabin is a place to unplug from electronics. Many of our cell phones don't even have service up
                there. We don't use
                the T.V. unless we need to check the weather which is not much. The only device we use up there is a
                radio to listen to
                Moose Country FM 106.7. Even though we don't have electronics there is plenty to do. We swim in the pond
                or go fishing of course.
                This year my boys enjoyed chasing and catching frogs or snakes. We have paddle boats to ride around on
                or row
                boats if we feel like it. If it's raining we go to town or work on our 1000 piece puzzle. One of our
                favorite
                activities is floating down the Flambeau River. The first couple years we floated on our paddle boats.
                The last
                few years we have been using this really cool giant party raft. </p>
            <p>Our cabin up north is my favorite vacation. I look forward to going every year. It's our place to be
                together and enjoy
                each our family.</p>
