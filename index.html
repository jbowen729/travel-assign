                <h2>Places I've lived</h2>
                <p>I live in Wonder Lake, Illinois. It is a small town just north of McHenry. I have lived here since
                    2012. I moved in with my sister and lived with her for two years. I moved into the house I live in
                    now in
                    November of 2014. My house is pictured below. It was in need of remodeling. My parents bought it in
                    October
                    and my boys and I could not even move in until a month later. I worked my tail off helping to fix it
                    up
                    and bring up my credit score. In 2017 I brought my credit score up enough so I could get approved
                    for a
                    mortgage loan. I bought my house from my parents and have been paying for it all on my own for 3
                    years now.

            <h2>Illinois & Wisconsin</h2>
            <p>I have lived in only two states. I grew up in McHenry, IL. The first time I moved out I moved into an
                apartment in
                Twin Lakes, WI with my sister. We only lived there one year. I moved back to McHenry, IL. I stayed in
                McHenry for quite some time
                before moving back to Wisconsin. This time I moved to Burlington. I lived there a couple years before
                moving to Ringwood, IL.
                I moved back in with my parents because I was struggling. Once I got back on my feet I moved to
                Richmond, IL. I got married
                but things didn't work out. I moved back to Ringwood, IL once again. Finally in 2012 I moved to Wonder
                Lake,IL where I plan to stay
                for a very long time.</p>
